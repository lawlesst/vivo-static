Deploying VIVO as A Static Site

Presenters: Ted Lawless, Alexandre Rademaker and Fabricio Chalub


### Install & Configure

A running VIVO instance populated with people and publications data is required as well as access to the VIVO SPARQL API.

The static app requires Python 2.7 (make work with 3.x but not tested) and the Python packaging tool pip.

####Install the web app

* `git clone https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-static.git`

* `cd vivo-static/web`

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* `cp .sample-env .env`

* Adjust values in .env to match your VIVO instance. This means setting the VIVO URL, username, password, and data namespace. This file is used to set environment variables that allows vivo-static to connect to VIVO.

* `source .env`

* `python app.py`

* visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser

* at this point you should be seeing the working vivo-static application

#### Generating the static site

vivo-static uses a tools called Frozen-Flask to generate the HTML and CSS necessary for hosting the app as a static site. 

To generate the static site, from within the "web" directory run `python freeze.py`. This will create a `build` directory of the static assets for the site. Depending on the amount of data you have loaded into VIVO, this could take a while. 

To test your sample site, `cd build` and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to simulate hosting a static site. 

#### Deploying to Amazon S3
If you want to deploy your site to Amazon S3, install the AWS command line tool: 

`pip install awscli`

Run `aws configure` to setup the client.

Then sync your build directory to your S3 bucket:

`aws s3 sync build/ s3://yourbucket`


### Application details

The application consists of routes and template handling in `app.py`.

`backend.py` contains the queries sent to the VIVO store for each of the views. This is where a majority of the application logic takes place. If you are not seeing data when running the site, this is where changes should be made.

The `templates` directory contains the Flask templates that generate the HTML from the Python objects created from SPARQL queries.
